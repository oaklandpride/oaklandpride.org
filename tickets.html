        <p>We hear you, and we know that a ticket price can feel like a <strong>barrier</strong>.</p> 
        <p>The truth is, <u>the Pride parade will always be free</u>—that's our commitment to a public act of resistance and celebration for everyone.</p>
        <p>Your ticket to the festival, however, is a direct investment in the <strong>safety, visibility, and sustainability</strong> of our community's future. The funds raised ensure that we can provide essential security and medical services in a world where anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment is on the rise. They also allow us to <strong>pay a diverse array of queer and trans artists</strong> for their invaluable labor, and <strong>support the year-round work of local nonprofits</strong> like the Oakland LGBTQ Community Center.</p>
        <p>Oakland Pride isn't just an event; it's a community-funded effort to protect and uplift our people.</p>
