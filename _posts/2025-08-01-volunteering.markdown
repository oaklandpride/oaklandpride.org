Oakland, the countdown to Pride 2025 has begun! 🏳️‍🌈 This year, our theme is **"Unity in Community,"** a celebration of the powerful, diverse, and resilient spirit that defines our town and our movement. As we prepare for our most vibrant celebration yet, we’re calling on the people who make it all possible: **you**.


Pride isn't just a parade or a festival; it's a declaration of love, acceptance, and solidarity. It's a grassroots effort powered by passion, and our volunteers are the heart and soul of the celebration. By volunteering, you help create a safe, joyful, and unforgettable experience for thousands of people.

### Why Your Help Matters

From setting up the first booth at dawn to guiding the last float in the parade, our volunteers ensure that Oakland Pride runs smoothly. You are the friendly faces that welcome visitors, the helpful hands that support our artists, and the steadfast guides who keep everyone safe. You are the community in action.

### How Can You Get Involved?

There's a role for everyone, no matter your skill set or availability. We need enthusiastic folks to help with:

* **Event Setup & Teardown:** Be the first to see the festival grounds come to life.
* **Parade Marshals:** Help guide our fabulous parade and keep the energy high.
* **Information Booths:** Be a welcoming resource for attendees looking for information.
* **Accessibility Team:** Ensure every member of our community can enjoy the celebration.
* **Green Team:** Help us keep Oakland beautiful by promoting recycling and composting.
