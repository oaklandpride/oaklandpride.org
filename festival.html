        <h2>Getting Here</h2>
        <p>Parking will be extremely limited, so we strongly recommend using public transportation.</p>
        <p><strong>BART:</strong> The 12th St. Oakland City Center and 19th St. Oakland stations are both just a short
            walk from the festival entrance. This is the easiest way to get to the celebration.</p>
        <p><strong>AC Transit:</strong> Numerous bus lines serve the downtown Oakland area. Check the AC Transit website
            for routes and schedules.</p>
        <p><strong>Ride-Sharing:</strong> If using a ride-sharing service, set your drop-off point a few blocks away
            from the festival grounds to avoid traffic congestion.</p>
