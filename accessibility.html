        <p>Oakland Pride is for everyone. We are dedicated to creating an inclusive, accessible, and welcoming experience for all members of our community. Below you will find detailed information about the accessibility services offered at the 2025 Oakland Pride Parade & Festival.</p>
        <p>Our theme, "In Unity, We Thrive!", means ensuring that every person, regardless of ability, can fully participate in the celebration.</p>

        <h3>Site & Venue Accessibility</h3>
        <p><strong>Festival Grounds:</strong> The festival is held on the paved streets and plaza surrounding Oakland City Hall. The grounds are generally flat and navigable for wheelchairs, scooters, and other mobility devices.</p>

        <p><strong>Accessible Restrooms:</strong> ADA-compliant portable restrooms will be available throughout the festival grounds. Please see the festival map for exact locations.</p>

        <p><strong>Seating:</strong> While the festival is primarily a standing event, limited seating will be available near the main stage and in designated rest areas.</p>

        <h3>Parade Viewing</h3>
        <p>An <strong>Accessible Viewing Area</strong> for the parade will be located at a designated spot along Broadway, offering a clear and less-congested view of the procession. This area will have space for individuals using mobility devices and will offer some seating. Please check the parade route map for the exact location.</p>
