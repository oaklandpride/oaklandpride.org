        <p>This September, the streets of Oakland will once again pulse with the vibrant colors of love, resistance, and
            radical joy. Join us as we march, dance, and cheer at the 15th Annual Oakland Pride Parade!</p>
        <p>This isn't just a parade; it's a powerful declaration. It's a celebration of every identity, a testament to
            our community's resilience, and a promise to continue fighting for a future where everyone is safe, seen,
            and celebrated. From the roar of the Dykes on Bikes to the rhythmic steps of our community dancers, every
            moment is a piece of our collective story.</p>
        <h2 class="p-2 text-bg-warning">In Unity, We Thrive!</h2>
        <p>This year's theme, <strong>"In Unity, We Thrive!"</strong>, is a call to action. It's a recognition that our
            strength comes from our diversity and our power comes from standing together. We invite you, your friends,
            your family, and your allies to join us as we embody this theme and fill the streets of The Town with an
            undeniable message of solidarity.</p>
