## A Glimpse into History

The history of Downtown Oakland is deeply connected to the city's development. Frank H. Ogawa Plaza, now a focal point for community gatherings and civic life, was once known simply as "City Hall Plaza." It was renamed in 1996 to honor Frank H. Ogawa, a dedicated civic leader and the first Japanese-American to serve on the Oakland City Council. This plaza, with its iconic fountain and open space, has long been a center for public discourse, protest, and celebration.

Just steps away stands the magnificent Oakland City Hall, a Beaux-Arts masterpiece completed in 1914. At 320 feet tall, it was once the tallest building west of the Mississippi River. Its grand architecture and central location symbolize the city's governance and its enduring strength. The surrounding streets, like Broadway, have been central to Oakland's commercial life for over a century, evolving from a bustling hub of department stores and theaters to a diverse district of modern businesses, restaurants, and cultural venues.
