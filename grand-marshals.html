                    <p class="fst-italic">"It is absolutely one of the honors of my career to be a grand marshal at Oakland Pride. It is right up there with winning Celebrity Jeopardy, being awarded four Emmys, and having Ericka Huggins tell me that she would happily show up to my kid's school to help me straighten out a teacher, if I needed her to. When I moved to Oakland in 1997, as a young 24 year old who had only met one openly gay person, I never could have imagined that being honored by Oakland Pride was in my future. I am only here because of the LGBTQ+ folks who have allowed me to be in community with them, build with them, call me in when I'm wrong, and who have shared my work when I do something that they believe is worthy."</p>

                <p class="lead text-muted">Filmmaker, "Father of Black Gay Cinema"</p>
                <p>Known as the "Father of Black Gay Cinema," Patrik-Ian Polk and his two decades of groundbreaking work have been called "the blueprint" by Black queer artists like Lena Waithe (The Chi, Master of None, Twenties), Justin Simien (Dear White People), Tarell Alvin McCraney (Moonlight), Stephen Canals (Pose) and Elegance Bratton (The Inspection).</p>
                <p>A native of Hattiesburg, Mississippi, Polk made his filmmaking debut in 2000 with Punks, the first U.S. film centering Black gay characters, produced by Babyface and Tracey Edmonds.</p>
                <p>In 2004, he created the first Black gay TV series, Noah's Arc, a comedy following the lives of four Black gay friends in Los Angeles, and its follow-up feature film, Noah's Arc: Jumping the Broom—receiving the GLAAD Award for Best Film and three NAACP Image Award nominations.</p>
                <p>Polk's other film credits include The Skinny, starring Jussie Smollett and Blackbird starring Oscar-winner Mo'Nique. Other TV credits include the Being Mary Jane series finale movie, Showtime's The Chi and STARZ drama, P-Valley—for which Polk won his first NAACP Image Award. This summer Polk premiered Noah's Arc: The Movie, a brand new installment of the series, currently streaming on Paramount+.</p>
